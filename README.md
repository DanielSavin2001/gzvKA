## Project Overview

Welcome to the **"Ge zijt van Kapellen als ge ..."** project, an initiative dedicated to preserving and showcasing the rich history and culture of the beautiful town of Kapellen, Belgium. This project originated from a passionate community group and aims to revitalize the existing website, transforming it into an intuitive, responsive, and innovative archive that captures the essence of Kapellen.

### Background
The original website served as a simple image repository, housing a diverse collection of photographs related to Kapellen, including people, streets, schools, hairdressers, and other interesting subjects. However, the current website is outdated, unintuitive, and not responsive, making it challenging for users to navigate and explore the content.

### Project Goals
Our primary objective is to upgrade the website into a quick-accessible archive that is both user-friendly and responsive. We aim to create an engaging platform that allows the community of Kapellen to explore and relive their town's history, fostering a sense of pride and nostalgia.

## Features and Enhancements
- **Intuitive Navigation**: Simplify the navigation to enhance user experience.
- **Responsive Design**: Ensure the website is fully responsive across all devices.
- **Innovative Elements**: Incorporate interactive features to make the browsing experience engaging and informative.
